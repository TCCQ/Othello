This is a program to simulate the Othello Board game in Java.
Othello is also sometimes called Reversi.
This is a work in progress.
The current version should be playable, but lacks polish and some more bug testing.

Black goes first
Pass the Game constructor a string for the type of game, and file name and some data about the 2 players. if the type is not CVCS, the other entries do not matter.

The bots are being adjusted so that I can apply machine learning to them to optimize them.  That is still down the road, however. 
All mid-game output is terminal based, and I have no intention to change that for the time being. 

The code is not clean, I am sorry.
